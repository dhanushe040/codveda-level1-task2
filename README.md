📊 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This task involved analyzing the Churn Prediction Dataset to uncover patterns and relationships that could influence customer churn.

🔧 Tools Used
Python

Pandas for data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

📌 Key Steps & Insights
1. 📈 Summary Statistics
Calculated mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for numerical features.

Helped understand central tendencies and variability in customer behavior.

2. 📊 Data Visualization
Histograms to explore distributions of features like Total day charge, Customer service calls, etc.

Boxplots to compare call volumes between churned and non-churned customers.

Scatter plots to visualize relationships between features such as Total day minutes vs Total day charge.

3. 🔗 Correlation Analysis
Identified strong correlations between:

Total day minutes and Total day charge

Total eve minutes and Total eve charge

These insights can guide feature selection for predictive modeling.

📁 Dataset
Source: churn-bigml-80.csv

Contains customer usage metrics and churn labels.
